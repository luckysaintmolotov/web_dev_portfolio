## Overview  

This repository is intended as a learning sandbox for:

- Simple static web projects (HTML + CSS + JS)  
- Folder‑based organization of independent demos  
- Quick deployment with GitHub Pages (no build step required)  

All demos are deliberately lightweight, making them ideal for teaching, prototyping, or sharing on a personal portfolio site.
