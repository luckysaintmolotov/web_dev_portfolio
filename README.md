A collection of small, self-contained web pages that showcase  HTML/CSS/JavaScript concepts. Each folder contains a standalone demo that can be opened directly or through the main index.html in the root folder.

## Overview  

This repository is intended as a learning sandbox for:  
- **Simple static web projects** (HTML + CSS + JS)  
- **Folder-based organization** of independent demos  
- **Quick deployment** with GitHub Pages (no build step required)  

All demos are made through online tutorials or from boredom and the desire to challenge myself.
